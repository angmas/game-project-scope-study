# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
```
see jpgs added to this project:
GameBoard.jpg
Login.jpg
PlayAgain.jpg
```

-   The data structure you plan to use.
```
   Probably something like the RunTracker we did in class where you
   have the Player object with an array of games and methods that calculate
   the number of wins and losses, the number of times they were Xs and Os
   and such
```
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
```
   I plan to model the code after what we did in the memory game
```
-   How you plan to approach this project.

```
  - one feature at a time. But not sure at the moment. Need more time to think on
    it.
    - Create user
    - Login
    - Game board
    ```
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
```
  - As a player, I want to play tic tac toe with another player
  - As a player, I want to keep track of my wins and losses
  - As a player, I want to place my pieces (X or O) with a click of a mouse button
  - As a player, I want to password protect my account so that others cannot sabotage my score
  ```

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
```
not sure yet, but probably similar to what we have been doing in class. I like to
copy patterns, reuse/update existing apps.
```

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
```
  - I'll figure that out after I get the minimal viable product built
  ```
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
```
  - I'm not sure, but probably using various git branches to control dev updates
     vs. releases
     ```
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
```
  - Only if I have time
  ```

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
